# Class Polymetrics

## Data acquisition with inFamix

To get the metrics for a Java, C, or C++ project use [inFamix](http://www.intooitus.com/products/infamix). On Linux simply call inFamix like this

    inFamix -lang ( cpp | java | c ) -path path/to/project -mse path/to/msefile.mse

On OS X, depite the fact that inFamix is packaged like an application, it must also be used from the command line:

    ./inFamix.app/Contents/MacOS/inFamix -lang ( cpp | java | c ) -path path/to/project -mse path/to/msefile.mse

Copy the MSE file into the _public_ directory and rename it to `data.mse`.

MSE is a file format. The files generated by inFamix use the MSE format to write FAMIX models. Information about FAMIX and MSE can be found on the [Moose Technology]() website.


## Displaying the polymetric views

After making sure that a file containing the metrics exists in JSON format in `data/data.json`, start the webserver as follows:

    ruby server.rb 

If you get an error about the Sinatra Ruby gem missing:

    gem install sinatra

After that open a webbrowser at [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567). The port number may vary depending on your Sinatra configuration.


## The MSE parser

The MSE parser in `public/mseparser.js` was generated with [PEG.js](http://pegjs.majda.cz/). The grammar is included in `mse/mse.pegjs`. If you want to modify the grammar and regenerate the parser, run the `generate.sh` script. You will need Node.js, npm, and the pegjs package  to do so. Detailed instructions are available in the [PEG.js documentation](http://pegjs.majda.cz/documentation).
